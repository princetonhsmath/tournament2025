            <p>
                Princeton Math Tournament (PMT) is a math tournament hosted by Princeton High School's Math Team for
                students in grades <b>3-8</b>, in teams of 1-3. The
                tournament will be hosted at Princeton High School (<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ihQnVks9quU4dz8HA"
                    target="_blank">151 Witherspoon St., Princeton NJ</a>) from 10AM -
                5PM on Saturday, January 31st. Additionally, for those unable to make it to Princeton, New Jersey, the
                tournament is also held <b>online</b> on <b>February 1st</b>! (Note that those within ~30 or 40 minute
                driving distance away must attend the offline option).
            </p>
            <h3 id="structure">Tournament Structure</h3>
            <p>
                Competitors will be split into two divisions. Division A will be grades 6 - 8; division B will be grades
                3 - 5.<br>
                The tournament will consist of four rounds. Note that the specific times of each of the rounds 
                is slightly less than the time slot on the schedule: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Sprint Round is 40 minutes 30 quetsions for Div A, 30 minutes 20 questions for Div B.</li>
                <li>The Target Round is 30 minutes in total, with students receiving 4 pairs of questions (8 questions in total) 
                    with 6 minutes to work on each pair and a 2 minute break after in between each pair.</li>
                <li>The Puzzle Round will last 30 minutes, and students will be given 5-6 sets with 3-4 questions in each set. 
                    Each set will introduce students to a new math topic that they most likely have not seen before.</li>
                <li>The Team Round will be 40 minutes and consist of 8 sets with 3 questions in each set. 
                    The last set will be estimation problems.</li>
            </ul>
             <!--<ul>   
                <li>A 40 minute sprint round consisting of 30 problems</li>
                <li>A (roughly) 30 minute target round consisting of 8 problems presented in pairs of 6 minutes each
                </li>

            <h3 id="prizes">Prizes</h3>
            We're offering a ton of exciting prizes this year!
            <ul>
                <li><b>All</b> participants will recieve a card deck or rubix cube</li>
                <li>The first <b>50</b> to register will get PMT drawstring bags</li>
                <li>All participants will recieve a special <i>PMT</i> clipboard</li>

            </ul>
            <br />
            The 10 highest scoring individuals of each division will recieve cash prizes! Additionally, we will have plushies of varying sizes for the top 5 individuals of each grade.  <br />
            <br />
            In addition, the two highest scoring teams of each division will recieve Math Competition Training books, courtesy of AwesomeMath. The top team will receive trophies, and each member of the top 3 team of each division will also receive plushies. <br />
            <br />
            Each of the above, alongside the winners of the puzzle and team rounds, will recieve medals and recognition for their performance at our awards ceremony.

            <br /> <br />For online participants, PMT will recognize the top individual competitors with cash prizes in both divisions, plushies for top 3 teams, and plushies for top 3 individuals of each individual. 
            Additionally the top 5 individuals of each division will receive cash prizes. <i>Note that the prize pool for the online tournament is slightly smaller as the prize values for the online and offline tournaments are adjusted to be proportional to the number of participants.</i>

                        Students will join via zoom on their phone and have their device propped up to show their desk, tables, workspace,
                        computer screen, and keyboard. As for answer submissions, we will either be using a google form or an online platform
                        that locks the computer screen (way of submission will be decided by January 25th). Students will be able to collaborate
                        in teams by unmuting and discussing in Zoom breakouts. <br />
                        <br />
                        If you are a teacher/coach/parent signing your math club / students for the competition, having them together in the
                        same place to compete is optional: We proctor them on Zoom meaning they will only be able to talk to each other if they
                        are physically located in different places, whereas if you are able to set them up all in one room, they would also be
                        able to pass scratch paper to each other etc. and coordination within the team would be easier. In that case, only one
                        device would be required to join the zoom meeting to capture the room as best as possible. <br>
                        <br />
                        Tl;DR if your students signing up are all from the same school/the same region, it would definitely be the most helpful
                        for their collaboration (i.e. Puzzle and Team round) that they meet in a physical room at school with you supervising.
                        However, this is not required for them to compete as we allow cross-state teams for the online tournament.

                        Students do not need a chaperone – we will have a number of volunteers and supervisors looking after the kids! However,
                        we do need an adult to be with them when they check in in the morning. If you wish, parents / coaches are encouraged to
                        stay, and we will have events for them up until noon including an Estimathon. (Note however we do not provide food for
                        parents but we have free pizza for all participants, and those who stay are encouraged to explore the restaurants and
                        stores in town as well as the university which is only a 10-15 minute walk away). Additionally, we'll be sending out
                        waivers before the tournament, which parents will need to fill out.

            Our core team is made up of 11 dedicated members of Princeton High School's Math Team, collaborating with
            numerous volunteers from West Windsor Plainsboro schools and Princeton University. We bring problem-writing
            experience from participating in numerous national competitions including HMMT, MMATHS, and ARML and placing
            in multiple tournaments over the past years including PUMaC, HMMT, and Purple Comet. Our team members also
            bring past experience from organizing large-scale academic competitions and events for youth including
            HackPHS, Integirls NJ, and the Gauss Math Tournament.<br><br>
